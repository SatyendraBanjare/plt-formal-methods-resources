# Programming Language Theory & Formal Methods - Reading Materials 

Formal methods are mathematical techniques that are used for design, verification and specifications of software and hardware problems. These are essentially a subset of **Programming Language Theory research** that are being used to study complex computer science problems.

Analysis by Formal Methods basically involves these steps :
1. `Formal Specification`  
2. `Formal Proofs` 
3. `Model Checking` 
4. `Abstraction` 

Here is my attempt to curate a list of useful reading materials and tools accompanied by some upcoming challenges in the field.

**Note** : The reader is expected to have some basic knowledge of type theory. I highly encourage going through resources mentioned in here [learn-tt](https://github.com/jozefg/learn-tt).


## Books & Lectures

- **Software Foundations** https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/ : I highly advice this as a starting material for diving deep into this field. The book is very helpful in building basic concepts and serves as a very sound introduction to the research field.

- **Interactive Theorem Proving - Adam Chlipala**

- **Abstract Interpretation - Patrick Cousot**
